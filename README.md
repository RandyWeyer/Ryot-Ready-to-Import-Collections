# Ryot Ready to Import Collections
This repo contains no code. It contains several collections that are ready to be imported into [Ryot](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot) as Generic JSON.

# Data Caveats
I tried to remove most of the aftermarket and unreleased games. Some unlicensed games remain, but a lot of times the unlicensed games are an important part of the library, like with the Atari 2600 and NES. There's no keyword to sort those out completely, so they remain.

The WiiU collection includes all the WiiWare. Again, there's no keyword to sort those out. 

Some platforms have too many games to be converted with convertcsv.com. Anything with over 5,000 titles takes hours and may just not work at all, so I'll need to find another method.
