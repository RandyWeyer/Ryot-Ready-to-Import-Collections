You've gotta be good to fly against these guys... or be ready to take the flak.  \"262s-low!\" Assassin radioed.  Great! We'd caught those Messerschmitt jets just before they'd reached their unstoppable speeds. I ordered the squadron to attack.  Then, out of the corner of my eye- Focke Wulfs! Damn! They'd been waiting up there, but I didn't keep one flight high- a rookie mistake! Now we were all low and slow- meat to those guys.  \"Break!\" I shouted as I kicked the rudder. As tracer fire flew past me, I jammed the stick into my stomach and felt the Mustang shake as she approached departure. Spin now, this low, and I'm dead; but a gentle turn was not an alternative.  An explosion! Next thing I saw was a Focke Wulf tumbling, belching smoke. \"Thought y'all could use a hand,\" I heard in a soft, Texas accent. It was Killer of the 335th. That voice and handle never went together. The FWs scattered. Time to reacquire those jets.  Only in Air Warrior can you experience air combat with this kind of realism while flying in any of 19 legendary warplanes of the World War II era. And with Air Warrior's options for stand-alone play, head-to-head modem play, and GEnie network/on-line arena play, there's a theater available for every combat pilot from Novice to Ace.  Air Warrior lets you polish your air combat tactics in off-line missions with or against up to ten computer controlled pilots. Film your toughest missions and re-fly them to sharpen your skills even further. Go head-to-head against a friend or foe in modem-to-modem airspace. And once you think you have the mettle for on-line air combat, take to the skies as a \"lone wolf\" or in a squadron with up to 100 simultaneous combatants from across North America and Japan.

The highest priority now was to carryout research into new energy sources, preservation of the enviro- ment and maintenance of the cultural heritage. However, at the dawn of the 21st century, provision of considerable funds from an unknown source released by the politicians of the new, unified government, permitted a return to the space research programme.  The conquest began gradually with the construction of huge, manned artificial satellites. Several lunar bases were created with the view to becoming future Earth colonies within the solar system. The considerable advancements made together with the supply of increasingly greater sums of money allowed man to explore, even as far as the planet Titan.

In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines.

The protagonist of the story is Akiko Sonoyama (������������), freelancer who finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery after the son of the host dies during the dinner right after drinking the wine. The game uses live-action videos and actors and shows the player protagonist in 3rd-person during investigation, similar to other games of such era, such as The Beast Within or Phantasmagoria 2. During gameplay, the full-screen videos appear in the center of the screen with surrounding window showing various action icons and game progress. While the player character appears during cut-scenes and dialogues, navigating environment is done using 1st-person perspective. During dialogues player has a list of questions one can ask with replies being a set of live-action videos of certain character addressing the player. 15 years after the 3DO game release, the PSP remake with the same title was released. The main difference there is that live actors have all been removed and characters were replaced with silhouettes and game interface changed to look like a mystery visual novel but with a selectable actions such as talk or inquire which make the game less of a typical visual novel and only resemble it in graphical presentation by using static backgrounds with dialogue text over it.\t\t\n4238\tSuper Street Fighter II Turbo\texpanded_game\t1994-03-23\t82.5249830932061\t\t['Fighting']\t['Action']\t['Street Fighter']\t['Street Fighter', 'Street Fighter II']\t['Capcom']\t\t['GameTek, Inc.', 'Capcom', 'Matsushita Electric Industrial']\t['Arcade', 'Amiga CD32', '3DO Interactive Multiplayer', 'DOS', 'Amiga']\t['Side view']\t['Single player', 'Multiplayer']\t['CP System II (CPS-2)']\t[1244, 1246, 1242, 1243, 1245, 1655, 5524, 6703, 7364, 6704]\t['martial arts', 'death', 'hand-to-hand combat', 'bromance', 'time limit', 'multiple endings', 'kung fu', 'high score', 'bonus stage', 'super-ness', 'character select screen', 'human', 'sumo wrestler', 'special attacks', 'super combo', 'release upgrade', 'shoto-clone', 'evo championship series', 'animation canceling', 'book adaptation', 'rushdown', 'bots', 'continue countdown', 'adapted to - anime', 'music speed up', 'adapted to - movie']\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gh2.jpg\tSuper Street Fighter II Turbo, released in Japan as Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge, is a competitive fighting game released for the arcades by Capcom in 1994. It is the fifth installment in the Street Fighter II sub-series of Street Fighter games, following Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers. Like its predecessor, it ran on the CP System II hardware.  Super Turbo introduced several new gameplay mechanics not present in previous versions of Street Fighter II, including the addition of Super Combos and air combos. It also introduced the secret character Akuma, who would go on to become a recurring character in later Street Fighter installments and other Capcom fighting games.  Super Turbo was originally ported to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, followed by the PlayStation and Sega Saturn (under the title of Super Street Fighter II Turbo: The Ultimate Championship) as part of the Street Fighter Collection, and for the Dreamcast in Japan under the title of Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service. A remake of the game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 titled Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/sc7ip5.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/sc7ip6.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/sc7ip4.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/sc7ip3.jpg']\t\n37118\tESPN Let's Play Tennis\tmain_game\t1994-03-31\t\t\t['Sport']\t\t\t\t\t\t['Intelliplay']\t['3DO Interactive Multiplayer']\t\t['Single player']\t\t\t['edutainment']\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3yhy.jpg\tESPN Let's Play Tennis is a Sports game, developed by Intellimedia and published by Intelliplay, which was released in 1994.\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scwdl0.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scwdl1.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scwdl2.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scwdl3.jpg']\t\n37119\tESPN Let's Play Soccer\tmain_game\t1994-03-31\t\t\t['Sport']\t\t\t\t['Intelliplay']\t\t['Intelliplay']\t['3DO Interactive Multiplayer']\t\t['Single player']\t\t[116353, 116352, 109606, 116350, 116349, 116351, 114286, 116343, 114287, 93920]\t['edutainment']\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3yi8.jpg\tESPN Let's Play Tennis is a Sports game, developed by Intellimedia and published by Intelliplay, which was released in 1994.\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scwdky.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scwdkz.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scwdkx.jpg']\t\n38817\tESPN Step Aerobics\tmain_game\t1994-03-31\t\t\t['Sport']\t['Action']\t\t\t\t\t['Intelliplay']\t['3DO Interactive Multiplayer']\t\t['Single player']\t\t[60044, 118871, 114285, 20342, 15851, 116353, 103218, 121036, 113895, 77529]\t['fitness', 'edutainment', 'abstract', 'box art - real photos', 'full motion video', 'sponsored by a tv network']\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/aqk4mg4r8zg7kjxyq7kj.jpg\tAn exercise game for the 3DO.

The Investigator finds a large house in the middle of nowhere that belonged to Dr. Hauzer. The home is built over an archeology site, with Doctor Hauzer having become obsessed with a deity named Kellbim. It is up to you to find Doctor Hauzer and what happened to his interns.  One of the earliest Survival Horror games, Doctor Hauzer was released as a Japan exclusive for the 3DO by a development studio that was well-known for their detective\\mystery visual novels, top-down RPGS, Point-&-Click Adventure games, and Japanese localizations of Western games like Prince of Persia up till this point. Doctor Hauzer was Riverhill Soft's first foray into 3D. Influenced by the successful Alone In The Dark, your character will navigate a fully 3D environment and die numerous times in the house's deadly traps, including some that are unavoidable for first time players. You have unlimited save games so you can view the death animations as part of the fun. You can switch the view between first-person, third-person, or overhead. Choosing a different view will help you overcome some traps, including some platforming.  There are several major reasons why this game was never released outside Japan: It's relatively easy with no monsters to fight, is roughly 1-hour long, has an incredibly bad framerate that can get as low as 3 frames-per-second (the 4DO emulator can \"overclock\" the CPU up to 400%, making it less choppy), some music is plagurized like the theme song being a near identical copy of the Beetlejuice movie's theme, and was on a platform that was already failing in the West.

It was initially released for the PC-9821 computer platform in 1994, followed by remade versions for the 3DO in 1995, and the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, despite plans for an English localization of the Saturn version. On August 24, 2009 (in honor of the 46th birthday of the game designer, Hideo Kojima), an unofficial English translation patch was released onto the internet.  The game is set in a primarily first person perspective and uses a point-and-click interface: the player can move the cursor and have the protagonist (Jonathan Ingram) analyze objects around his environment or talk to other characters in the game. Like in Snatcher, the game features shooting segments where the player must defend their character from incoming enemies. The player can use the shooting trainer at the police department to test their reflex and accuracy. There are numerous puzzles in the game, including an event where the player must dismantle a bomb by following their partner's instructions.  The console versions of the game all include support for their respective mouse peripherals. The Saturn version features light gun support for the shooting segments.  The game was notable for being an early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a theme revolving around space exploration and occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to Snatcher, but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. Policenauts also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player's memory of the plot upon reloading a save, an element Kojima would later use in Metal Gear Solid. The PlayStation version of Policenauts could also read the memory card and give some easter egg dialogues if a save file of Konami's dating sim Tokimeki Memorial is present, a technique Kojima would also later use in Metal Gear Solid.\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/cea49tmoeewk9hl3xkhi.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/nwksgvp5dithojjqt2tb.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/agl7sesx0uqfyuipf7rg.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/eowmmxvazu3cusnb46tc.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/gxnnrchp5sthc9m9rejc.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scf9fn.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scf9fo.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scy1pb.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scy1pc.jpg']\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/ar3vcf.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/ar3vcg.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/ar3vch.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/ar3vci.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/ar3vcj.jpg']\n4271\tPrimal Rage\tmain_game\t1994-08-01\t61.0401139282219\t50\t['Fighting']\t['Science fiction']\t['Primal Rage']\t['Primal Rage']\t['Atari Games']\t\t['Playtronic', 'Atari Games', 'Tec Toy', 'Time Warner Interactive']\t['Arcade', 'Super Nintendo Entertainment System', 'Sega 32X', 'Sega Mega Drive/Genesis', 'Sega Game Gear', '3DO Interactive Multiplayer', 'DOS', 'Amiga', 'Atari Jaguar', 'Atari Jaguar CD', 'Sega Saturn', 'PlayStation']\t['Side view']\t['Single player', 'Multiplayer']\t\t[89550, 24620, 290164, 210838, 175926, 39780, 26227, 17130, 146832, 11834]\t['dinosaurs']\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co309j.jpg\tA meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos.

From a secret lab you log into the simulation which sends you to a place in Perfect known as the Garden. Every entity in the game has a certain rank that determines its offensive and defensive capabilities. You start at 255, the lowest rank, and must rise in ranks to defeat Perfect1, who holds rank number 1. To do so, you destroy higher-ranked Rithms, as the other entities in the game are called. To pass beyond certain ranks, unique Rithms high in the Perfect hierarchy have to be destroyed.  Different weapons and power-ups can be collected and spent offensive and defensive energy can be recharged at energy spires. In the center of the Garden is a place called DOAsys, which functions as a neutral zone and healing center. There you can talk to other Rithms and ask for hints about combating special Rithms and where to find special items. These dialogue sequences take the form of live action clips of actors in elaborate costumes playing the Rithms.  When the player logs out of the simulation or is violently forced out, he returns to the lab where one may load and save a game and access detailed statistics on the trips to Perfect.\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupam.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupau.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupap.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupas.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupav.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupax.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupar.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupan.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupao.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupaw.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupaq.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scupat.jpg']\t\n172768\tCrayon Shin-chan: Puzzle Daimaou no Nazo\tmain_game\t1995-03-10\t\t\t['Puzzle']\t['Comedy']\t['Crayon Shin-chan']\t\t['Tose']\t\t['Bandai']\t['3DO Interactive Multiplayer']\t['Side view']\t['Single player']\t\t[95776, 19222, 87507, 41349, 119412, 90839, 25905, 327378, 321909, 294413]\t\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kh2.jpg\tIt's a puzzle game similar to Puyo Puyo with the theming of Crayon Shin-Chan, and lots of little animations and a ton of voice acting.\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scdsud.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scdsue.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scdsuc.jpg']\t\n214778\tBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S\tmain_game\t1995-03-17\t\t\t['Fighting']\t\t\t['Sailor Moon']\t['Tose']\t\t['Bandai']\t['3DO Interactive Multiplayer']\t['Side view']\t\t\t[89550, 109277, 346147, 122898, 103269, 101608, 76852, 61985, 103288, 114145]\t['japan only']\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5u24.jpg\tBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S is an Action game, developed by TOSE and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1995.

You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages.

There are in fact two stories in the game, featuring two different characters, who live in different provinces of the Empire. The boy Wallace enjoys a peaceful life with his family in a quiet village; the girl Rakjit witnesses persecution and death of her mother, and joins a resistance movement that specializes in magics. The paths of the two young people will eventually lead to the same goal - liberation of the world; but when and how it will be achieved, remains unclear...  The game plays for the most part like a traditional Japanese-style top-down RPG. Both Wallace and Rakjit eventually gather a party, which roams the world, visiting various locations and advancing the story in a predominantly linear fashion. Appearance of random enemies triggers a battle screen, which is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battle system is rather old-fashioned, with physical and magical attacks; level progression is automatic, as in most games of the genre.  Sometimes the game prompts the player to choose an action or a response; while the flow of the story is rarely influenced by the player's decision, the game keeps track of these decisions, evaluating the player's attitude between chapters.\t['https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scplpw.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scplpx.jpg', 'https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_screenshot_big/scplpy.jpg']\t\n4264\tOlympic Games: Atlanta 1996\tmain_game\t1996-05-06\t\t\t['Simulator', 'Sport']\t\t\t['Olympic Games']\t\t\t\t['3DO Interactive Multiplayer']\t\t\t\t[119422, 118871, 100359, 114285, 116353, 112846, 115869, 116667, 103218, 106814]\t['polygonal 3d', 'year in the title', 'button mashing', 'summer olympics']\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co48z2.jpg\tOlympic Games: Atlanta 1996 is a video game tie-in to the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics.\t\t\n93021\tComplete Onside Soccer\tmain_game\t1996-06-21\t\t\t['Sport']\t\t\t\t['Elite Systems']\t\t['Telstar Electronic Studios Ltd.']\t['3DO Interactive Multiplayer', 'DOS', 'PlayStation']\t['Third person']\t['Single player', 'Multiplayer']\t\t[116353, 116352, 109606, 116350, 116349, 116351, 116343, 93920, 114286, 116575]\t\thttps://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7zvz.jpg\tComplete Onside Soccer is a football simulation game programmed by Elite Systems and published by Telstar Electronic Studios for the PlayStation and Windows.
